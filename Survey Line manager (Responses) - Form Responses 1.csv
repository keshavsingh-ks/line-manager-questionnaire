It's difficult to train managers on how to manage every possible scenario that they could encounter with Early Talent. Many managers have limited exposure to early talent and the generational differences, so they need a lot of support from the business. We offer workshops in person and virtually. For the first 3 months, we have regular check ins and then follow up every six months to ensure managers feel supported. We have an Early Careers hub internally which is used for managers or Grads to have easy access to information - this is beneficial for managing early talent on a day to day basis.",,Female,1-3 years,Technology
